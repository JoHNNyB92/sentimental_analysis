# Sentiment Analysis

The project contains the  classification of tweets in categories, according to their polarity (positive, negative,neutral). 

The needed datasets have been downloaded using the SemEval tools, and downloaded files can be found at

GitHub:https://github.com/MSc-in-DataScience/class_material/tree/master/semester_2/Natural_Language_Analytics/Exercise_2-
TwitterSentimentAnalysis/data

All tweets that were not available during downloading (containing the message “Not Available”),
are removed before any further analysis and processing.

The project is separated into two basic questions:

## Question A:

• We use the training, development and test examples, in order to create and evaluate a supervised
classifier for tweets with the help of a machine learning algorithm and feature set. 

## Question B:

We apply an existing application for sentiment analysis on twitter data, in order to classify and evaluate only the
test example and compare its performance with the performance of the supervised classifier obtained in
question A.
